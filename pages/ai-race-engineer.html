                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    While playing the F1 video game, the player needs to access and keep track of various kinds of data
                    while focusing on driving. This requires the player to press buttons and navigate menus while
                    driving. To solve this I created an AI race engineer. The AI race engineer simulates the real-life
                    role of a race engineer who communicates with the driver during a race. In both the game and in the
                    real world, telemetry data is constantly generated. This data is expansive and covers information
                    such as tire and brake temperatures, car damage, lap times, track conditions, and much more. The AI
                    race engineer uses the telemetry data from the game to provide the player with real-time race
                    updates and answers to their questions.

                <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding the format of the raw data was difficult and it took many hours to understand the
                        structure of each packet type</li>
                    <li>The aim of the system was to be fully offline, so it was difficult to implement STT and TTS</li>
                </ul>
